I hope you're looking forward to the \"which famous hacker character from popular media are you?\" quiz, which is also currently in the works. It's Boris. It was always <a href=\"https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Boris_Grishenko\">Boris.</a>\n<em>He is invincible.</em></p>\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/hNJwTYxnfK3te\" width=\"100%\" height=\"240\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<p>Without further ado, here's an <em>unordered list</em> of things that come to mind for helping your dev team perform their best, with no particular audience in mind.</p>\n<h2>Communication is Key</h2>\n<div style=\"width:100%\"><iframe allow=\"fullscreen\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"205\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/s6p6vmUzFEKupjJj00/video\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Before embarking on any sizable new project, it's vital to have a lengthly, documented  discussion about what every stakeholder expects the finished product to be.</strong></p>\n<p>It's weird to even have to point this out, but sometimes, amongst our refinements, syncs, standups, planning sessions and ad-hoc meetings, we can miss the proverbial forest for the trees.</p>\n<p>Not only is it important to have subject-matter experts in the room, but the people who are <em>actually going to do the work</em> have <em>got</em> to be there too. With any luck, those people should ideally be the same people. If they're not, account for <strong>more time</strong> to do the planned task(s), as these people will need to exchange knowledge and expertise, whether sync (with another technical handover meeting) or async (via documentation and messaging).</p>\n<p>Requirements change. Such is life. We can't do much to stop life being life, but what we can guard against miscommunication and misunderstanding (which effectively change the requirements, even if the underlying cause is internal) by communicating, planning and documenting merticulously and fastidiously.</p>\n<h2>Help them help themselves help us all</h2>\n<p><strong>Give your devs the tools they need to do the job.</strong></p>\n<p>This doesn't necessarily mean hardware or office furniture either; think about how your team is organised. Are you in-office, hybrid or remote? Do you span multiple time-zones? What's everyone's first language? Morning-person or night-owl? How many on your team have children to pick up from school, or relatives to look after?</p>\n<p>How do you organise information? Is everything scattered across hundreds of Jira ticket comments across six different epics, with the rest buried in a Slack thread from an archived private channel from six months ago? How do other teams organise their documentation? Do your devs have sufficient time in the sprint to document their systems and services? Can they see other teams' documentation? Here's a big one: <em>do they have the credentials to access any required external services?</em> If not, do they know where to go, or who to ask?</p>\n<p>Do your devs know the rest of the org? If they notice that an issue will impact a data team pipeline, or a QA test regimen, or they need to ask for an infrastructure change, do they know who to talk to? Could a PM take over that conversation and let the dev get back to building?</p>\n<p>These are all just rhetorical questions designed to get you thinking about whether your rituals and ways of working are the most conducive to the kind of deep focus that software can often require.</p>\n<h2>Hold that invite...</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch\">Context switching</a> is overhead.</strong></p>\n<p>At this point in our post-COVID world the <em>\"meetings suck and I hate them\"</em> discourse feels pretty passé. I feel that meetings are important, and are sometimes the most efficient way to get a number of people all on the same page with the opportunity to ask questions as soon as they arise.</p>\n<p>Now I've said that, I can also say: meetings induce mental <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)\">overhead</a>, and, if the purpose of the meeting can be achieved to an acceptable level by an email chain, it should by all means be cancelled. By \"mental overhead\", I mean that meetings require more from the person than just their attention <em>during</em> the meeting. If I'm deep in the weeds of some payment processor integration logic, and I have a meeting in 10 minutes, I need to drop everything to mentally prepare–<em>what questions do I have? Do I have any documentation or data I need to present? Will I be asked any questions?</em> Otherwise, without preparation, the meeting itself might be wasted as it becomes a series of, <em>\"oh, well, let me go see if I can find that out and I'll get back to you tomorrow...\"</em> and another TODO is added to the list.</p>\n<p>There's also an important point to make here regarding meetings are <em>truly necessary</em>. We love meeting because it all feels very official and like <em>serious work</em> is getting done–but is it really? Personally speaking, I've been in meetings in the past with, like, two team leads and three different department heads all discussing a problem that might best have been solved by giving a couple of mid-level devs a half-sprint to focus on it. Instead, we have 5 different action items across three departments... you get the gist.</p>\n<p>Now, once the meeting is over, I need to go back to where I was and try to remember all the bits of context I was trying to keep in mind. <em>Was this variable an array or a mapping again? ...and wait, why are we calling this external function? What in the world was this bitwise operator doing in here?</em></p>\n<p>This is all lost time that needs to be spent again, just to get back to where we were before the meeting notification pinged us.</p>\n<p><em>Wait... who scheduled another meeting directly after that one!? It's not even 11am yet!!!</em></p>\n<h2>He Protec but He Also Attac</h2>\n<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/xT5LMX1HX4Lwys905i\" width=\"100%\" height=\"366\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Distractions attack from all sides! Defend your team's focus.</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the very best managers, team leads, and product managers are the ones who can shield their team so they can focus on achieving goals, instead of responding to events ad-hoc.</p>\n<p>I like the analogy of the Tank, a character stereotype from multiplayer team-based shooters and MOBAs. They have a lot of HP, they are big and charge in at the front, soaking up a lot of damage so that the more nimble and specialist teammates at the back can sneak forward and capture the flag, or blow up a tower, or push a cart, or do whatever other strange thing the game devs have thought up.</p>\n<p>In any size of organisation there will always be things that need to be done. A great manager will help the team prioritise, manage external expectations, and sometimes respond with clear and emphatic 'No's. You only have as much capacity as you have, and ensuring that you keep your sprint goals and targets realistic will go a long way to keeping team the team's morale, focus and productivity high.</p>\n<h2>What Kind of Dev Are You?</h2>\n<p><strong>Different folks have different feelings about engineering.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Well, duh.</em> This may sound banal, but hear me out: understanding the philosophical attitude of developers you're working with will help you make better project decisions.</p>\n<p><em>Philosophical attitude!?</em> Yep. Indulge me. So there was once this guy called Plato.</p>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Plato._Etching_by_D._Cunego%2C_1783%2C_after_R._Mengs_after_Raph_Wellcome_V0004702.jpg\" style=\"width: 50%; display: block; margin: 20px auto;\">\n    <h6>\n        It's Plato! (actually, this is now thought to be a nickname given to him by his wrestling coach due to his wide build, \"Platon\", literally meaning \"broad\"... I guess the ancient Greek equivalent of being called \"MrBeast\" or \"Absolute Unit\"?)\n    </h6>\n\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Plato had many ideas, but among them is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms\">Theory of Forms.</a><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> You might also know them by the term \"Platonic ideal\". Without getting too deep, the Theory of Forms is about ideals. More specifically, Plato argues that there exist timeless, immutable, absolute ideas, or Forms, which are the non-physical <em>essences</em> of things. Anything that exists in reality is just a pale immitation of its ideal, its <strong>Form.</strong></p>\n<p>I like to think of Forms as a little bit like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)\">classes</a> in programming. It doesn't map perfectly, but a class encapsulates some common traits among a certain group of objects, and dictates how all members of the class should operate, and, most importantly; <em>is used to instantiate concrete instances of a given class of object.</em> Forms are similar, they are the ideal of a given class of physical (or even mental) thing, like bicycles, horses, bananas and even friendship or love. Plato argued that, while not physically real, Forms played an essential part in how we understand and categorise things, and are extremely useful practically as measure of comparison or a thought tool.</p>\n<p><em>OK. So what the hell does this have to do with developer productivity!?</em></p>\n<p>Given any sufficiently complicated software system, a good engineer begins to daydream, \"how could this be better?\" and, depending on the quality of the codebase, \"this would be so much easier if...\" can be a daily–or even hourly–thought.</p>\n<p>Whether we know it or not, in these moments we are considering the Form of this system. In this idealised notion, the system is 100% available, as secure as a nuclear bunker, easy to debug, uses a thimble of memory, runs in constant time and deploys everywhere instantly. It's unrealistic, but that's the point, it's the Platonic Ideal of the system.</p>\n<p>Some devs are much more concerned about this than others. Others just want to ship new features and Get Stuff Done. There is a rough correlation here between the dichotomy of focussing on optimisation and developer experience versus accumulating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt\">tech debt</a> and shipping new features. In my experience these things <em>aren't always mutually exclusive,</em> but there is a spectrum of attitudes here and this also varies depending on the team or project as well. It's also probably wise to mention the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#cite_ref-autogenerated268_5-0\">\"premature optimisation is the root of all evil\"</a> take here.</p>\n<p>If you can identify where your team sits on the spectrum of idealifying versus featurifying, it will help you understand their motivations and drives, and also help highlight pain points in the product or the developer experience that may end up coming back to bite you later. A good example might be issues bringing up a local dev environment; sooner or later, you'll have a new dev on your team or someone from another team will need to work on your domain and you'll need to spend a 3 hour call walking them through all the workarounds you need to get started. yikes!</p>\n<p>In short, this is a very elaborate way of saying: if you listen closely to the feelings of your dev team and how much of an appetite they have for building new features, you'll probably learn some useful things. Maybe even <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/story-real-canary-coal-mine-180961570/\">canary-in-the-coalmine</a> things.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\"
