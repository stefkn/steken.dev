The birth of the feed! 

Since Twitter is like, somehow even worse than before now? and Threads is more power to the all-powerful Zuck, I thought I would just make my own cute lil newsfeedy type thing on here, and I can post smol  updates and cool things and whatever like how we used to back in the good old days. 

No election interference, billionaire meltdowns or crypto scambots. 

just cool stuff. 

neat.
