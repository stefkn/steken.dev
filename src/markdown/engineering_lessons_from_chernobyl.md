One of my favourite YouTube rabbit holes (I am, like most of my cohort, hopelessly addicted to YouTube) is the [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/USCSB) of the little-known Federal agency of the [USCSB](https://www.csb.gov/about-the-csb/) – the *United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board* – who go to the trouble of CGI-animating industrial accidents of varying severity and having a narrator explain the various mistakes and bad choices that led up to the incident. Then, they conclude with a summary of useful best-practices we can all follow (mostly aimed at process safety engineers, but accessible enough for a general audience) which are, usually, pretty universal. It tends to boild down to things like _"do regular safety inspections of your equipment"_ and _"don't ignore loud beeping safety alarms"_ and _"don't manually override emergency failsafes"_.

Inspired by this, and having watched the excellent HBO series on Chernobyl, I decided there could be a great talk to be made about the engineering lessons that could be learned from the accident at the Chernobyl NPP. It was a little rushed, and you'll need to imagine what I waffled about as I kind of freestyled, but anyway: Here are the slides!
