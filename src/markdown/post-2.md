title: "Functional Programming in Scala for Dysfunctional Programmers"
---

Don't tell anyone, but I've `accidentally a book` from the office. It's a slim, shiny, almost red Japanese-lacquerware-colored volume called Functional Programming with Scala, by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason. I don't know if it's a particularly popular or well-regarded book, but I feel bad having had it for so long without really checking it out--So I'm distilling what I'm learning for it here in this multi-part series.

Since we've adopted Jira at work, I guess the Enterprise Programmer™ inside me is yearning for some Java-ey ness.
