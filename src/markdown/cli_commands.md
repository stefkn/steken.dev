I definitely can't claim to be a CLI expert. However, it's sometimes the easiest way to achieve something when you're outside of the bounds of something that a UI can express for you, or you want to do something super specific and/or repetitive. It does start to feel pretty `leet h4ck3r` when you begin to grasp the concept of the Unix pipe system and chaining together multiple commands into a useful magic incantation. I'm not quite there yet myself, but hope to be there some day!
